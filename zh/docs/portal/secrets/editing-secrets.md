3. Make your changes in the Update Secret form.Â Required fields are denoted by an asterisk (\*) and described in [Creating a Secret](</docs/portal/secrets/creating-secrets.md>).

**Note:** If you change the secret name, property versions that refer to that secret will fail [validation](</docs/portal/tasks/validations.md>) and will have to be updated. However, if a property that was using the secret has already been deployed to staging or production, the property is not affected by the name change.

4. Click the **Update** button.
