## {{productNameCDN}} Key Features

{{productNameCDN}}'s key features make it easy for anyone with a minimum background in CDN to get started, while offering powerful features for advanced users as well.
- A rich API, Edge Logic, and processing at the edge enable you to implement features at the CDN level without touching your application codebase.
- You can configure {{productNameCDN}}, test its behavior in a dedicated staging environment, and then deploy to production in minutes, without long wait times to create and change configurations by email or phone calls. {{productNameCDN}} also allows you to self-configure edge servers and customize GSLB service maps.
- Flexible cost/performance management empowers you to self-customize service coverage to manage expenses according to the performance you need.
- State-of-the-art load balancing dynamically monitors the Internet to direct traffic based on real-time performance metrics and system-load information.

- With points of presence deployed on every continent, {{productNameCDN}} routes user requests to edge servers based on factors such as proximity and resource/content availability, reducing workloads on origin servers by more than 90%. Cached content on the edge remains available even if the origin server stops responding to requests.

## {{productNameCDN}} Application Programming Interface (API)

The {{productNameCDN}} content delivery platform provides a rich [API](</apidocs>) that supports the same functions as the {{productNameCDN}} GUI, along with advanced configuration capabilities. Using the API, developers can have their applications interact with {{productNameCDN}} by sending and receiving JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data.
